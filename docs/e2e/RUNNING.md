# How to run the E2E suite

A practical run guide. For architecture and layout, see `README.md`.

## 1. One-time setup

These are checked once per machine, not per run.

- **Docker running** — `docker version` must succeed.
- **pytest installed** — `python3 -m pytest --version`. If missing, run
  `python3 -m pip install -r e2e/requirements.txt` from the repository root.
  (Already installed? Then nothing to do — you don't reinstall before each run.)
- **Rust toolchain** — only needed the first time the gateway is built / the
  in-container daemon is packaged.

## 2. Quick start

```sh
cd e2e
python3 -m pytest test_smoke.py # one-test gateway/list check
python3 -m pytest -m smoke      # broader cross-family smoke tier
python3 -m pytest               # the whole suite
```

The gateway is started automatically on the first test that needs it and reused
afterward — you do **not** start it by hand.

The harness routes logical `manager`, `runtime`, and `observability` calls to
the matching root wrapper and preserved binary. Semantic routes come from
`sandbox-operation-catalog`; `sandbox-cli` owns each binary's projection and
argv parsing; `sandbox-operation-client` owns shared discovery, value-based
request construction, and gateway transport.

## 3. What to run

| Command | Runs |
|---|---|
| `python3 -m pytest test_smoke.py` | one gateway/list test |
| `python3 -m pytest -m smoke` | broader smoke tier across test families |
| `python3 -m pytest manager` | manager lifecycle, export, and squash tests |
| `python3 -m pytest observability` | aggregate and sandbox-scoped public snapshots |
| `python3 -m pytest runtime` | command, file, session, and security tests |
| `python3 -m pytest config` | serial gateway configuration tests |
| `python3 -m pytest` | everything |
| `python3 -m pytest manager/management` | one family |
| `python3 -m pytest manager/management/test_management.py::test_sandbox_lifecycle` | one test |
| `python3 -m pytest -v` | verbose per-test names |
| `python3 -m pytest -x` | stop at first failure |

Exit code is `0` only when everything that ran passed.

## 4. Customize a run

All knobs are environment variables (defaults in `core/config.py`); set them
inline for one run:

```sh
E2E_IMAGE=debian:12 python3 -m pytest manager                  # different image
E2E_WORKSPACE_VARIANT=special_case_b python3 -m pytest manager # different repo/ workspace variant
E2E_REBUILD_BINARY=0 python3 -m pytest test_smoke.py           # fastest one-test cold start
```

Workspace variants live under `repo/` — one host directory per variant
(`repo/testbed`, `repo/special_case_b`, …), bind-mounted into the sandbox as its
workspace root. `repo/testbed` is the default.

| Variable                      | Default             | Controls                                          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `E2E_IMAGE`                   | `ubuntu:24.04`      | Docker image for new sandboxes                     |
| `E2E_WORKSPACE_VARIANT`       | `testbed`           | variant subfolder under `repo/` (bind-mounted)     |
| `E2E_WORKSPACE_ROOT`          | `repo/<variant>`    | absolute host workspace root (overrides variant)   |
| `SANDBOX_GATEWAY_CONFIG_YAML` | `<repo>/config/prd.yml` | daemon/sandbox config YAML used by the gateway  |
| `E2E_REBUILD_BINARY`          | `1`                 | cold-start gateway with `--rebuild-binary`          |
| `E2E_PROGRESS`                | `0`                 | `1` streams daemon-side op progress live (`--progress`) |
| `E2E_OP_METRICS_DIR`          | `<repo>/docs/obsidian/ephemeral-os/testing/file-operation/operation-timing` | latest per-operation timing artifacts |

## 5. Metrics & in-flight logs

Enabled by default in `pytest.ini` — no extra flags needed:

- **Live logs** (`log_cli = true`): each test streams its operations as they
  happen. The `e2e.cli` logger prints every domain CLI call and its result with
  elapsed time (`→ …` / `← … (exit=0, 0.03s)`); `e2e.gateway` logs
  bring-up; `e2e.timing` prints a per-test total.
- **Per-test timing** (`--durations=0`): a `slowest durations` table at the end
  with a `setup / call / teardown` breakdown per test, plus the live
  `⏱ <test> — N.NNNs total` line during the run.
- **Per-operation timing artifacts**: every run that calls one of the three
  domain CLI binaries writes `latest.md` and `latest.json` under
  `E2E_OP_METRICS_DIR`. The summary groups client-side CLI wall time by
  operation and includes count/min/p50/p95/max plus the measured percentage of
  calls under 50 ms, 100 ms, and 200 ms. This is measurement only; the suite
  does not enforce a timing SLO.

Useful overrides:

```sh
python3 -m pytest -m smoke                # broader smoke tier with live logs + timing
python3 -m pytest --log-cli-level=WARNING # quieter (suppress the per-op INFO lines)
python3 -m pytest -q --no-header          # compact
python3 -m pytest -s                      # also stream raw subprocess output
                                      #   (e.g. the gateway cold-start cargo build)
E2E_PROGRESS=1 python3 -m pytest manager # stream daemon-side op progress live
                                      #   (workspace base copy/hash for create_sandbox)
```

`log_cli` streams our logging records live; raw stdout/stderr of subprocesses
(like the gateway build) is still captured unless you add `-s`.

`E2E_PROGRESS=1` adds the manager CLI's global `--progress` flag so
long-running manager operations (notably `create_sandbox`, which copies and
hashes the workspace base) stream their progress lines live through the
`e2e.cli` logger (prefixed `‖`). The runtime and observability binaries do not
accept that flag. Final JSON is still parsed normally, so assertions are
unaffected.

## 6. Gateway & cleanup

- **First run** (no gateway up) cold-starts it via
  `../bin/start-sandbox-docker-gateway` — with `--rebuild-binary` when
  `E2E_REBUILD_BINARY=1`, which may take a while (cargo build + daemon package).
- **Later runs** reuse the running gateway (instant). It is left running between
  runs on purpose; restart it with `../bin/start-sandbox-docker-gateway` if needed.
- Every sandbox / workspace session a test creates is destroyed by fixture
  teardown — even when the test fails. Logs are never scraped; results come from
  each operation's JSON.

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **pytest is unavailable** → `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
  (or run `python3 -m pytest ...`).
- **Cannot connect / gateway never ready** → check Docker is running, then look
  at `/tmp/eos-gateway.log` and the pid in `/tmp/eos-gateway.pid`. Force a fresh
  gateway: `../bin/start-sandbox-docker-gateway --rebuild-binary`.
- **`create_sandbox` errors with `start_container: expected value at line 1
  column 1`** → that is a backend (Docker provider) failure, not a test bug. The
  suite is reporting it faithfully; the create path must be fixed in
  `crates/sandbox-provider-docker` for the manager tests to pass.
- **First cold start is slow** → expected (it builds/packages binaries). Use
  `E2E_REBUILD_BINARY=0` once the daemon artifacts in `dist/` are current.
