# LayerStack Squash Live-Docker Catalog Mirror

Source of truth: `docs/obsidian/ephemeral-os/implementation_plan/squash/test-case.md`.

This suite mirrors all catalog IDs under `manager/management/squash/` and writes
`test-reports/<RUN_ID>/<CASE_ID>/verdict.json` for every executed case.

SMK-05 treats `crates/sandbox-operations/catalog/src/manager.rs` as the
semantic declaration owner, `crates/sandbox-cli/src/projection/manager.rs` as
the CLI presentation owner, and
`crates/sandbox-manager/src/operations/registry/management_operations.rs` as
the handler binding.

Allowed skips, matching section 5.3:

| Case | Allowed reason |
| --- | --- |
| HRD-04 | subcases-9-11 |
| HRD-12 | leg-b:not_constructible_at_ci_scale |
| HRD-17 | failure-leg:gate_green_env |

## Measurement Kit

Each case creates one live Docker sandbox, drives
`sandbox-manager-cli squash_layerstacks` through structured JSON, records
S0-S3 disk snapshots where applicable, captures `T_squash`, `T_quiesce`,
`T_remount`, and `T_e2e` timers, checks correctness/space/time axes, and writes
teardown evidence for an empty lease registry, no `.remount-*` residue, empty
`staging/`, and strict unmount cleanup. The suite writes `SUMMARY.md`,
`timing-distribution.json`, and the HRD-20 `soak-baseline.json` under
`test-reports/<RUN_ID>/`.

## Current Proof

Final consecutive full runs on 2026-07-03:

| Run id | Pytest result | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `squash-20260703-031940` | `50 passed in 129.14s` | `51` run, `51` pass, `0` slow, `0` fail, `0` skipped |
| `squash-20260703-032157` | `50 passed in 128.64s` | `51` run, `51` pass, `0` slow, `0` fail, `0` skipped |

Final verdict audit: 51 `verdict.json` files, no failed correctness, space,
time, or teardown axes. Allowed partial notes only: HRD-12 leg b and HRD-17
failure leg, both as catalog section 5.3 permits.

Speed note: the post-rebuild baseline full run was
`squash-20260703-030503` at `50 passed in 246.54s`; the optimized harness
finishes at `128.64s` by using structured `file_write` for small publishes,
concurrent synthetic layer publishing, and implicit-session command log artifact
writes.

## Extra HTTP Service Cases

`HTTP-01` and `HTTP-02` are additional medium-tier probes outside the original
50-case source catalog. Both start the service and client through
`sandbox-runtime-cli --sandbox-id <id> exec_command`. `T_http_disconnect` is
the largest observed silent gap on a persistent `/ticks` HTTP stream that emits
numbered lines every 1ms. The cases enforce the same correctness, space, time,
and teardown verdict axes.

## Extra Load Cases

`LOAD-499` publishes 499 tiny layers, proves the stack can be mounted, squashes
it, and verifies the first and last files remain readable. `LOAD-LARGE`
publishes one configurable large blob (`SQUASH_LARGE_FILE_KIB`, default 8MiB)
between small layers and verifies the byte count after squash.

`LOAD-499-HTTP` keeps the 499 tiny data-layer fixture, runs the HTTP helper
from `/run` during squash, and records `T_http_disconnect` as the maximum
observed stream silence. `LOAD-LARGE-HTTP` does the same around the large-file
fixture.

`LOAD-COMBO-HTTP` combines repeated small-file publishes, small overwrites,
real 2MiB large overwrites written with `dd`, 200 active workspace sessions,
background commands, four HTTP servers, and three squash rounds. Environment
knobs with the `SQUASH_COMBO_` prefix can scale those counts up to the bounded
fixture limits.
