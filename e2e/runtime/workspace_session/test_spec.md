# Workspace-Session Finalize-Policy Live-Docker Test Spec

Source of truth:
`docs/obsidian/ephemeral-os/implementation_plan/finalize-policy/spec.md`
(draft v2), implemented in commit `66f3921a8`
(`feat: workspace-session finalize-policy redesign`).

This spec covers two things:

1. **Compatibility** — how the existing live e2e suites must be updated for the
   new `create_workspace_session` / `exec_command` semantics.
2. **New coverage** — a case catalog under `runtime/workspace_session/`
   targeting `create_workspace_session`, `exec_command`, and the finalize
   policy, mirroring the verdict conventions of
   `manager/management/squash/test_spec.md`
   (`test-reports/<RUN_ID>/<CASE_ID>/verdict.json` per executed case).

## 1. What changed at the runtime surface

Workspace lifecycle is daemon-internal and is exercised through the test
harness's trusted authenticated direct-daemon helper. `exec_command` remains
public.
Responses and semantics changed:

| Operation | Change | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_workspace_session` | internal response gains `finalize_policy: "no_op"`; the operation has no public CLI/MCP command | visibility + additive |
| `exec_command` | response gains `workspace_session_id` on every yield (running and terminal, all drain paths) | additive |
| `exec_command` | terminal response gains `publish_rejected: true` + `publish_reject_class` when this command's completion ran a finalize whose publish was rejected; the unpublished changes are discarded and the destroy still happens | additive |
| `exec_command` (bare) | still implicitly creates a session, now named policy `publish_then_destroy`; the session id **escapes** in the response, so progress-check riders (`exec_command --workspace-session-id <id>` while the first command runs) are a supported pattern; a rider defers finalization until the last running command completes | semantic |
| `destroy_workspace_session` | remains an internal recovery primitive; refusal contract is unchanged (`error.details.active_command_session_ids`), but the check is now the session's own command ledger | visibility + semantic |
| file ops / remounts | never extend or trigger the session lifecycle; one racing the last command completion or a destroy now loses cleanly with `operation_failed` (“workspace session not found”) instead of running against a torn-down session | semantic |
| command drains | completed commands are retained up to 512 terminal entries per daemon; a drain (`read_command_lines` / `write_command_stdin`) against an evicted id returns `command not found` | semantic |
| observability snapshot | each workspace in the daemon snapshot JSON gains `finalize_policy` | additive |
| vocabulary | “one-shot”, “exec-owned”, “caller-owned”, “user-owned” are gone from op descriptions; say “implicit session (`publish_then_destroy`)” and “session (`no_op`)” | doc |

Everything the suite already asserts by **field lookup** (`result["..."]`)
keeps working — no existing assertion reads a key that was removed. Only
exact-shape assertions would break, and the audit below found none on these
operations.

## 2. Compatibility audit of the existing suites

Verified against the current tree (grep for `exec_command`,
`create_workspace_session`, `destroy_workspace_session`):

| File | Verdict | Required update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime/file/helpers.py` | compatible | Route lifecycle setup/teardown through the trusted authenticated direct-daemon helper and assert `finalize_policy == "no_op"`. |
| `runtime/file/**/test_*.py` (smoke, correctness, file_exec, blame, concurrent) | compatible | none — they assert by field lookup. Optional hardening: sessionless `file_exec` tests may assert the implicit exec response's `workspace_session_id` is present and no longer resolvable after terminal status (see EX-03). |
| `runtime/command/test_exec_command_layer_depth_benchmark.py` | compatible | none — it never drains more than 512 completed commands per daemon. Add a comment noting the retention cap so future depth extensions know drains of old command ids expire. |
| `runtime/test_squash_remount.py` | compatible | `_publish` uses a bare exec to publish a layer — that is exactly the implicit `publish_then_destroy` path and keeps working. No change. |
| `runtime/daemon_http/test_daemon_http.py` | compatible | none; optional: assert `finalize_policy` is present on snapshot workspaces (additive field). |
| `runtime/network_isolation/test_network_isolation.py` | compatible | none — network profile axis is orthogonal to finalize policy. |
| `manager/management/squash/helpers.py` | compatible | `_destroy_session` already handles the `active_command_session_ids` rejection loop — contract unchanged. Rename the two “one-shot exec capture …” comments (lines ~2051, ~2084) and the HRD-09 title “one-shot finalize mid-switch” to “implicit-session finalize …” — vocabulary only, behavior identical (HRD-09 exercises the same completion-edge finalize, now the policy runner). |
| `manager/management/*` (sandbox lifecycle) | unaffected | none. |

One **behavioral** re-check is required, not just vocabulary: any test that
races a session file op against `destroy_workspace_session` (today only the
in-repo Rust suites do) must expect the file op to fail `not found` rather
than run after the gate releases. No current Python test does this; new cases
WS-04/EX-06 below pin the behavior at the e2e level.

## 3. New coverage catalog — `runtime/workspace_session/`

Layout per the suite README: `runtime/workspace_session/{__init__.py,
helpers.py, test_workspace_session.py, test_exec_finalize.py}` plus this spec.
Helpers route public operations to the matching manager, runtime, or
observability binary and use the authenticated internal daemon helper only for
workspace-session lifecycle. They return parsed JSON; every case writes
`test-reports/<RUN_ID>/<CASE_ID>/verdict.json` with `correctness` / `teardown`
axes (timing axis only where noted).

Policy availability constraint: the public CLI cannot create any explicit
workspace session. The internal test setup creates `no_op` sessions, so
the e2e policy matrix is: explicit create ⇒ `no_op`; bare `exec_command` ⇒
implicit `publish_then_destroy`. Both rows are covered below.

### create_workspace_session (WS)

| Case | Tier | Title | Assertions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-01 | smoke | create response contract | `workspace_session_id` non-empty, `network_profile: "shared"` by default (`"isolated"` with the flag), `finalize_policy: "no_op"`; observability snapshot lists the workspace with `finalize_policy: "no_op"`. |
| WS-02 | smoke | no_op session survives command completion | create → `exec_command --workspace-session-id … 'echo hi'` to terminal → session still usable (second exec + `file_read` succeed) → explicit destroy succeeds. |
| WS-03 | smoke | destroy refuses while a command runs | create → start `sleep 30` with `--yield-time-ms 0` → destroy returns `operation_failed` with `error.details.active_command_session_ids == [<command id>]` → Ctrl-C via `write_command_stdin` → destroy succeeds. |
| WS-04 | medium | destroy always discards; sync op racing destroy loses cleanly | create → `file_write` a change → destroy → new implicit exec `cat` shows the change is **absent** (no publish on explicit destroy); a `file_read` issued immediately after destroy returns `operation_failed` not-found, never stale content. |
| WS-05 | medium | lifecycle is not public | the runtime CLI rejects `create_workspace_session` and `destroy_workspace_session` as unknown operations; top-level help omits both. |
| WS-06 | medium | destroyed id stays dead | after WS-02's destroy, `exec_command --workspace-session-id <id>`, `file_read`, and a second destroy all return `operation_failed` not-found (and the daemon does not wedge — a fresh create still works). |

### exec_command (EX)

| Case | Tier | Title | Assertions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EX-01 | smoke | implicit exec response contract | bare `exec_command 'echo hi'` terminal response has `status: "ok"`, `workspace_session_id` present, no `publish_rejected` key; the id is **not** resolvable afterwards (follow-up exec into it → `operation_failed`). |
| EX-02 | smoke | implicit exec publishes then destroys | bare `exec_command 'echo v1 > /workspace/e2e-implicit.txt'` → a **new** bare exec `cat /workspace/e2e-implicit.txt` reads `v1` (publish landed in the layerstack); observability snapshot no longer lists the first session. |
| EX-03 | smoke | session exec carries the session id | `exec_command --workspace-session-id <no_op id>` running and terminal responses both carry that `workspace_session_id`. |
| EX-04 | medium | rider defers finalization | bare `exec_command 'sleep 8; echo done > /workspace/rider.txt'` with `--yield-time-ms 0` → grab `workspace_session_id` → rider `exec_command --workspace-session-id <id> 'ls /workspace'` completes → session still alive (second rider works) → wait for the long command to finish → session finalizes: follow-up exec into the id fails, and a new bare exec `cat /workspace/rider.txt` reads `done`. |
| EX-05 | medium | publish rejection surfaces on the terminal response | bare `exec_command 'mkdir -p /workspace/layers && echo x > /workspace/layers/evil.txt'` (a layerstack-internal path) → terminal response `status: "ok"` **and** `publish_rejected: true` with `publish_reject_class: "protected_path"` → session is destroyed anyway (id unresolvable) → a new bare exec proves the mutation was discarded. The load-bearing assertions are `publish_rejected: true`, destroy-still-happens, and discard. |
| EX-06 | medium | file op racing the last completion gets not-found | bare `exec_command 'sleep 2'` with `--yield-time-ms 0` → tight loop of `file_read --workspace-session-id <id>` until it flips to `operation_failed` not-found; assert no read ever returns partial/torn state and the loop terminates ≤ 30 s (finalize completed). |
| EX-07 | medium | interrupt/timeout paths still finalize | bare exec `sleep 60` → Ctrl-C via `write_command_stdin` → cancelled terminal response carries `workspace_session_id`; session finalizes (id unresolvable). Repeat with `--timeout-ms 1000` and a timed-out status. |
| EX-08 | hard | drain retention cap | env-gated (`E2E_RETENTION=1`): one `no_op` session; run 520 fast `exec_command`s to terminal in it; drain the **first** command id → `operation_failed` command-not-found; drain the newest → still readable; session destroy succeeds (ledger is empty — retention never touches the ledger). |

### finalize policy cross-checks (FP)

| Case | Tier | Title | Assertions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FP-01 | medium | remount sweep cannot finalize an idle implicit session | start a bare long-running exec (its session is `publish_then_destroy`, ledger non-empty) and an idle `no_op` session; run `squash_layerstacks` (post-squash sweep remounts every live session) → both sessions survive the sweep (exec still drains; `no_op` session still resolves); then finish the command → only the implicit session finalizes. |
| FP-02 | medium | empty capture skips publish | snapshot the manifest version (observability layerstack view) → bare `exec_command 'true'` (no writes) → manifest version unchanged (no empty layer, no no-op publish), session destroyed. |
| FP-03 | medium | back-to-back implicit execs are independent sessions | two sequential bare execs return different `workspace_session_id`s; writes from the first are visible to the second (published layer), not via a shared live session. |
| FP-04 | hard | finalize-vs-destroy interleave storm | N=8 threads alternating bare execs and explicit create/exec/destroy cycles for 60 s; verdict: zero daemon faults, zero leaked sessions in the observability snapshot at the end, every explicit destroy either succeeds or reports `active_command_session_ids`. |

Timing axis: EX-04, EX-06, FP-01, FP-04 record wall-clock bounds in the
verdict (finalize observed within 30 s of terminal status); the others are
correctness/teardown only.

Teardown evidence for every case: after the family run, the observability
snapshot lists no workspace created by the case, and `destroy_sandbox`
succeeds (fixture-owned, mirroring `conftest.py`).

## 4. Harness work items

1. `runtime/workspace_session/helpers.py`: wrappers `create_session()`
   (returns the full JSON, asserts `finalize_policy`), `exec_bare()`,
   `exec_in()`, `destroy_session()` (returns raw result for refusal checks),
   `wait_finalized(sandbox_id, workspace_session_id, timeout_s)` — polls
   `exec_command --workspace-session-id <id> 'true' --yield-time-ms 0` until
   `operation_failed` not-found (the black-box finalize signal), and
   `interrupt(command_session_id)` (Ctrl-C via `write_command_stdin`).
2. `runtime/file/helpers.py`: assert `finalize_policy == "no_op"` in
   `create_workspace_session()`; no other change.
3. `manager/management/squash/helpers.py`: vocabulary rename only (§2).
4. Reuse the squash suite's verdict writer (or copy its minimal shape) for
   `test-reports/<RUN_ID>/<CASE_ID>/verdict.json` + a family `SUMMARY.md`.

## 5. Runbook

```sh
cd e2e
python3 -m pytest runtime/workspace_session -m smoke      # WS-01..03, EX-01..03
python3 -m pytest runtime/workspace_session               # everything except env-gated
E2E_RETENTION=1 python3 -m pytest runtime/workspace_session -k EX_08
```

Smoke tier must stay under ~60 s wall; medium under ~5 min; EX-08 and FP-04
are opt-in. Public calls go through the three purpose-built CLI binaries;
internal workspace-session lifecycle uses only the trusted authenticated
daemon helper's two allowlisted routes. Every assertion consumes structured
JSON — no log scraping, per the suite charter.
